Raspberry Pi 2 + OpenCV 3 Tutorial - Parts List

2 Raspberry Pi 2s (recommend to have an extra in case something goes wrong with one), ex:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13297
(or search Amazon.com for "Raspberry Pi 2", many distributors will appear)

2 RPi 2 cases (one case for each RPi 2), ex:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13103

2 16GB Micro SD cards (recommend to have an extra in case something goes wrong with one, 3 would be even better as these are small and easily lost or damanged), ex:
http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Memory-Adapter--SDSDQUAN-016G-G4A-Version/dp/B00M55C0LK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1441761120&sr=8-3&keywords=micro+sd+card+16+gb
http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Class-Adapter-MB-MP16DA-AM/dp/B00IVPU7KE/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1441761120&sr=8-7&keywords=micro+sd+card+16+gb
http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Memory-SR16UY2A-TQ-VERSION/dp/B00X1404P8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441761278&sr=8-1&keywords=sony+16gb+micro+sd+card
Note: the official minumum size is 8GB, 16GB would be recommended in case extra storage is necessary in the future, if you have a bigger SD already you can use that instead

extra monitor with an HDMI or DVI connector (or be willing to borrow one from your desktop temporarily)
extra monitor cable (HDMI on one end and either HDMI or DVI on the other end (whichever your extra monitor has))
extra USB keyboard and mouse (or be willing to borrow from your desktop temporarily)

wireless USB adapter (unless you plan on using a wired Ethernet connection)
most common USB wireless adapters work well with the RPi at this point, I can verify the following 2 work well out of the box (no configuration necessary other than entering the wireless network key into Raspbian before the first use):
http://www.amazon.com/Edimax-EW-7811Un-150Mbps-Raspberry-Supports/dp/B003MTTJOY/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1441760233&sr=1-2&keywords=USB+wireless+adapter
http://www.amazon.com/Panda-Ultra-150Mbps-Wireless-Adapter/dp/B00762YNMG/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1441760329&sr=1-1&keywords=USB+wireless+adapter+panda

5V wall power supply that can provide at least 2 amps and has a USB Micro-B end, ex:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12890
http://www.amazon.com/NorthPada-Supply-Charger-2000mA-Raspberry/dp/B00OY7HR1U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1441760390&sr=8-3&keywords=raspberry+pi+power+supply

if you plan on connecting more than 4 USB devices to the RPi simultaneously you will need a powered USB hub, ex.
http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Port-2-5A-power-adapter/dp/B00DQFGH80/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441762455&sr=8-1&keywords=powered+USB+3.0+hub
(to complete the video you will NOT need a USB hub, no more than 4 USB devices are connected at a time during the video)

breadboard, wires, multimeter, other typical electronic assembly tools and items, available from various retailers, ex:
http://www.elexp.com
http://www.amazon.com
https://www.sparkfun.com

adapter board and cable for connecting the RPi to a breadboard, this is not necessary but is very helpful when doing RPi projects that use more than a few of the RPi's pins

http://www.amazon.com/Sintron-T-Cobbler-Extension-Rainbow-Raspberry/dp/B00NWA2AS0

any relaively common Webcam, I can verify that the Logitech C310 and C920 work well with the RPi:
http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-960-000585-HD-Webcam-C310/dp/B003LVZO8S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441764797&sr=8-1&keywords=logitech+c310
http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Webcam-Widescreen-Calling-Recording/dp/B006JH8T3S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1441764825&sr=8-1&keywords=logitech+920
most likely any relatively common webcam will work well with the RPi as the USB camera support has been well developed by now

2 common servos, in the example video two Hitec HS-645MG are used
https://www.servocity.com/html/hs-645mg_ultra_torque.html#.VgTNg-SFO38
most relatively common servos will work

pan and tilt kit for servos, for example the following is used in the video:
https://www.servocity.com/html/spt100_pan___tilt_system.html#.VgTODOSFO38
alternatively you can make your own from sheet metal without too much difficulty
